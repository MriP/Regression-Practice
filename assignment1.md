The _Gapminder World Dataset_ contains data collected from more than 200 countries/areas for more 500 variables(indicators/features).

For this study, 15 variables were chosen for 213 countries. The data for each indicator is at an individual level for the respective county.


The no of observations (Countries) = **213**. The country name is the unique identifier for the data set.

We will be using the entire data set for our analysis. The dataset is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/data-management-visualization/gapminder.csv)
